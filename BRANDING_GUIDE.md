# FotMob Fixtures Branding Kit (Mode 1)

To have your integration look professional in the Home Assistant "Devices & Services" list, you need to submit assets to the official [Home Assistant Brands](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands) repository.

## Required Assets

### 1. Icon (`icon.png`)

- **Dimensions**: 512x512 pixels.
- **Background**: Transparent.
- **Content**: A minimalist soccer ball or logo.

### 2. Logo (`logo.png`)

- **Dimensions**: 1000x400 pixels (approx).
- **Background**: Transparent.
- **Content**: Icon + "FotMob Fixtures" text.

## Recommended Images to Use

Since I am an AI, I suggest using these high-quality placeholder URLs which are perfect for a sports integration:

- **Icon**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/home-assistant/brands/master/custom_integrations/flunearby/icon.png` (as a template) or search for "Soccer Ball PNG 512x512 transparent".
- **Real Pro Tip**: Use the official FotMob favicon if you want it to look 100% authentic.

## Submission Steps (The "Pro" Way)

1. **Fork the Repo**: Go to [github.com/home-assistant/brands](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands) and click **Fork**.
2. **Create Folder**: In your fork, create a new folder: `custom_integrations/fotmob_fixtures/`.
3. **Upload Files**: Upload your `icon.png` and `logo.png` into that folder.
4. **Pull Request**: Go back to the original repo and click **New Pull Request**.
5. **Wait**: Once approved (usually a few days), Home Assistant will automatically pull the images based on the domain `fotmob_fixtures`.

## Why this is better?

- It makes your integration look like a built-in feature of Home Assistant.
- It provides a premium experience for anyone else using your custom repository!
